Draft Version 0.04
==================

This is just a proof of concept to demonstrate an alternative
system for doing Computer Aided Design (CAD) centering on a truly
open file format.

Some basic drawing elements and a viewer have been implemented.

BUGS

 - Probably

TODO

 - None, otherwise this will become Yet Another Half-Finished CAD
   Program.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This package depends on perl and the following CPAN modules:

   Tk
   Tk::WorldCanvas
   Test::Helper
   SGI::FAM
   YAML

USAGE

Make sure that FAM is running; on my machine I need to do this:

   service portmap start
   service xinetd start

   (or manually start FAM: `/usr/bin/fam -T 0 &`)

Try and open some of the example drawings:

   tkdraft.pl t/data/arrows.drawing/ &
   tkdraft.pl t/data/arrow.drawing/ &
   tkdraft.pl t/data/crowd.drawing/ &
   tkdraft.pl t/data/people/ &
   tkdraft.pl t/data/fridge.drawing/ &

Zoom in and out with the 'i' and 'o' keys, pan the viewport with the
middle mouse-button and move items around with the left
mouse-button.

Note that whenever you move something, the change is immediately
committed to disk.  Any changes to one viewport are immediately
reflected in other viewports showing the same items.
