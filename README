Draft Version 0.05
==================

This is just a proof of concept to demonstrate an alternative
system for doing Computer Aided Design (CAD) centering on a truly
open file format:

    http://bugbear.blackfish.org.uk/~bruno/draft/

Some basic drawing elements and a viewer have been implemented.

BUGS

 - Probably

TODO

 - None, otherwise this will become Yet Another Half-Finished CAD
   Program.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This package depends on perl and the following CPAN modules:

   Tk
   Tk::WorldCanvas
   Test::Helper
   SGI::FAM
   YAML

It also depends on the command-line utilities 'diff' and 'patch' for
the undo/redo functionality.

USAGE

Make sure that FAM is running; on my machine I need to do this:

   service portmap start
   service xinetd start

   (or manually start FAM: `/usr/bin/fam -T 0 &`)

Try and open some of the example drawings:

   tkdraft.pl t/data/arrows.drawing/ &
   tkdraft.pl t/data/arrow.drawing/ &
   tkdraft.pl t/data/crowd.drawing/ &
   tkdraft.pl t/data/people/ &
   tkdraft.pl t/data/fridge.drawing/ &

Zoom in and out with the 'i' and 'o' keys, pan the viewport with the
middle mouse-button and move items around with the left
mouse-button.

Undo any action with the 'Ctrl-z' key combination and redo with
'Ctrl-y' - The undo history survives restarting the application.

Note that whenever you move something, the change is immediately
committed to disk.  Any changes to one viewport are immediately
reflected in other viewports showing the same items.
